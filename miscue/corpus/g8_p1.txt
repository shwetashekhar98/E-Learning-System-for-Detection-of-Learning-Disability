At half-past nine that night Tom and Sid went to bed as usual They said their prayers and Sid was soon asleep Tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten This was despair He would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was afraid he might wake Sid So he lay still and stared up into the dark Everything was dismally still By-and-by out of the stillness little scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice Old beams began to crack mysteriously The stairs creaked faintly Evidently spirits were abroad A measured muffled snore issued from Aunt Poly's chamber And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder it meant that somebody's days were numbered Then the howl of a faroff dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remote distance Tom was in agony At last he was satisfied that time has ceased and eternity begun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven but he did not hear it and then there came mingling with his half formed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling The raising of a neighbouring window disturbed him A cry of Scat You devil and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's wood-shed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on all fours He meow'd with caution once or twice as he went then jump to the roof of the wood-shed and thence to the ground Huckleberry Finn was there with his dead cat The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard
